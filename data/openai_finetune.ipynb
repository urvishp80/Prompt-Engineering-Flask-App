Having a common ending string appended to the end of the completion makes it clearer to the fine-tuned model where the completion should end. See https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset for more detail and examples.\n","- The completion should start with a whitespace character (` `).
